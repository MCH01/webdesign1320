        <h2>Brief History of Chess</h2>
        <p>The history of Chess is a very long history, and hard to sum up in a few sentences as it dates all the way back to the 600s AD India. Chess spread north, 
            east, south, and west very quickly, by the 11th century it had reached Japan and Korea. In Europe, it is found as early as the 10th century. Chess has slowly 
            evolved over centuries, with major changes taking place in 1300, 1475, and 1835. The first international chess federation, FIDE, was formed in 1924 and is 
            still around to this day. Chess has had many "crazes" throughout it's history, but only started becoming more mainstream in the second half of the 18th 
            century, and most recently, during the covid lockdowns. Social media has also played a part in this, with major social media starts playing the game for
            for their audiences. Today, websites like chess.com boast over 100 million users, and FIDE counts thousands of titled players amongst their ranks.</p>

            <h3>Basics of Chess</h3>    
            <p>Chess is a very easy game to learn the basics of, but extremely difficult to master. There are just six pieces, the pawn, king, queen, bishop, knight,
                and rook, with each side having a total of 16 pieces for a total of 32 on a 64 square board. There are a total of 1,327 named openings and variations
                in chess. When you start a game you want to control the center, keep your structure secure, and keeping your king safe. There are many resources to
                help you learn chess, for me personally I had a friend that helped me learn, and playing bots on chess.com helped a lot. I'd highly recommend
                learning the basics of chess, it's a fun game and keeps your mind sharp!</p>
