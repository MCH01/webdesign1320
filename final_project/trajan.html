                <h1>Trajan's Early Life</h1>
                <p>Trajan is the first Emperor who's reputation was truly deserved and has lasted the test of time. To give you an idea of how beloved and
                    influential he was when a new Emperor was confirmed by the Senate they would say "May he be luckier than Augustus, and better than 
                    Trajan." Trajan was born in Spain in the year 53 AD to a Senator and a Noblewoman who was a sister-in-law to Emperor Titus. Again, like
                    most Emperors very little is known about his early life however it is known that as a young man he joined the Legions, and did see combat.
                    Not much is known about his early military service, but he did end up as a Legate for the 7th legion. He ended up as a Consul not long
                    before he became Emperor and one last important note is when his Cousin died, he became the guardian for his two children, one of which was
                    the future Emperor, Hadrian. There isn't much to say about his rise to power, as you may remember from the page on Nerva, he was adopted by
                    Nerva (possibly unwillingly) and became Emperor without too much fuss once Nerva passed away.</p>

                <h2>Trajan As Emperor</h2>
                <p>Trajan's time as Emperor is something that I cannot do justice for in the paragraph I am about to write, I implore you to read up on it as
                    his time as Emperor is one of the most interesting subjects in history. His reign lasted from 98-117, a whopping 19 years that saw many
                    military campaigns and changes to the Empire, he was so beloved by his peers they bestowed the title "Optimus" or "Best" on him as well.
                    Trajan spent a large portion of his time as Emperor building, many of his buildings still stand today as well. A few examples of these
                    include Trajan's Bridge, Trajan's Forum, Trajan's Column, many libraries, and he reconstructed the famous Circus Maximus as well. One
                    of the most famous Roads, and one of many still around, was built by Trajan which was the Appian Way connecting Rome to southern Italy.</p>
                    <img id="image_resize_two" src="images/map.jpg" alt="117 Map">
                <p>When it comes to his Military campaigns, there is too much to talk about. Trajan spent much of his time as Emperor on campaign and it is
                    what he is most remembered for since, as stated before, during his reign Rome would reach it's peak size. One of the biggest threats to
                    Rome was the Dacian's, which unlike many of the tribes Rome had fought against in the past was an organized threat. Trajan launched two
                    bloody campaigns against Dacia between the years 101-102 and 105-106 leading to a major loss for Dacia, new Roman lands which included
                    important and massive gold mines and client kingdoms being set up East of Rome's new land. Trajan's Column which still stands in Rome
                    was built to commemorate his campaigns in Dacia. Another notable Campaign by Trajan was his war against Parthia, a long time enemy to
                    Rome. Trajan became the first Emperor to invade Mesopotamia bringing Rome's borders, albeit for a short time, to modern day Kuwait.
                    Finally, Trajan did deal with the Second Jewish-Roman War, which was an uprising by Jewish 'zealots' against Rome. The rebellion was
                    put down although according to (unreliable) ancient sources, Rome did suffer heavily in this war.</p>
                <h2>Trajan's Death and Legacy</h2>
                <p>Trajan grew ill and passed away quite quickly in 117, without publically announcing his heir. His wife supposedly hid his death long
                    enough to make sure Hadrian would be the heir, although this isn't known for sure. His legacy is a good one, with ancient sources
                    praising him as basically the perfect Emperor. One interesting note is that even Christians in the middle ages praised him as a
                    "good pagan". It cannot be denied however that he was as perfect as was said in the past, with many modern historians either
                    questioning his legacy or downright calling it false, and painting Trajan as a bad emperor.</p>
