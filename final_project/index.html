                <h1>Who We're They?</h1>
                <p>The five good Emperors of Rome we're an almost mythical lineup of what many historians would consider the best Roman Emperors. Their combined
                    rule lasted from the years 96, to 180. These five Emperors names were Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, and Marcus Aurelius. The most
                    recognizable name will likely be Marcus Aurelius thanks to the movie gladiator, and his literature works which can still be read today.
                    During their rule, Rome was arguably at it's most stable, and without a doubt at it's largest extent with Trajan's conquests in 117. The
                    main reason they are considered the five good emperors, however, is the prosperity and peace Rome had during their rule, something that both
                    before and after their time was uncommon to have for extended periods of time. This website should give you a basic insight into these
                    Emperors, but the history surrounding them is extremely interesting and there are plenty of resources to teach you more about this
                    fascinating period of history.</p>

                <h2>A Note</h2>
                <p>When it comes to ancient history, and that of Roman history, one has to keep in mind that the historians from these times are not
                    like the historians of today. Many accounts that we have from this time period are filled with lies or deceit, and you should take
                    any info you read about with a massive grain of salt.</p>
