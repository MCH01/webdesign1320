                        <td>The Antonine Plague ranks as the 8th deadliest epidemic in human history. In the Roman world there would be a much worse plague in the Justinian Plague, which would wipe out 7-56% of the world population, making it the 3rd deadliest epidemic.</td>
                        <td>As stated before you have to be careful when reading on these Emperor's, many of the historians to write about them that we think of ancient historians (Cassius Dio for example) we're not around for their reigns, some writing about it centuries later.</td>
                        <td>While these five men are named as the Five Good Emperors of Rome, they we're not the only ones considered good. Cases can be made for Emperor's such as Constantine, Aurelian, or Augustus could all be considered greater than even these Emperor's.</td>

                        <td>The Roman Empire would fall less than 300 years after their reign in 476 AD, not counting the Eastern Roman Empire. To give you an example of how long 300 years is, the US has only been a country for 247 years.</td>
